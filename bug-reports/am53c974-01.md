# Null pointer access in do_busid_cmd()

# Member access within null pointer of type 'SCSIDevice' (aka 'struct SCSIDevice')

[A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter
emulation of QEMU. This issue occurs while handling the 'Information Transfer'
command. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on
the host, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this
vulnerability is to system availability.](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-35505)

is not easily applied to QEMU 5.1.0 because of dramatic code change.
