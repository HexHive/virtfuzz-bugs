The size of the memory region of imx-usb-phy is 0x1000.

```
memory_region_init_io(&s->iomem, OBJECT(s), &imx_usbphy_ops, s,
                          "imx-usbphy", 0x1000);
```

A read to s->usbphy[33] will easily overflow.

```
static uint64_t imx_usbphy_read(void *opaque, hwaddr offset, unsigned size)
{
    // ...
    default:
        value = s->usbphy[index];
        break;
    }
```

Maybe we should drop this read in default branch.
